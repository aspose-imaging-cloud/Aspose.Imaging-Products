Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/crop/dng), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/crop/dng), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/crop/dng), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/crop/dng), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/crop/dng), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/crop/dng)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

DNG is a digital camera image format used for the storage of raw files. It has been developed by Adobe in September 2004. It was basically developed for digital photography. DNG is an extension of TIFF/EP standard format and uses metadata significantly. In order to manipulate raw data from digital cameras with ease of flexibility and artistic control, photographers opt camera raw files. JPEG and TIFF formats store images that are processed by the camera, therefore not much room for alteration is available in such formats.
