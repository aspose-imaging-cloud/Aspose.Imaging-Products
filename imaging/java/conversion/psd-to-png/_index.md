Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/conversion/psd-to-png), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/conversion/psd-to-png), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/conversion/psd-to-png), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/conversion/psd-to-png), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/conversion/psd-to-png), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/conversion/psd-to-png)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that use loseless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports loseless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the mostly used image file format. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of installation.
