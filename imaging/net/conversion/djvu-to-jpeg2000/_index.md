Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/conversion/djvu-to-jpeg2000), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/conversion/djvu-to-jpeg2000), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/conversion/djvu-to-jpeg2000), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/conversion/djvu-to-jpeg2000), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/conversion/djvu-to-jpeg2000), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/conversion/djvu-to-jpeg2000)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

DjVu, pronounced as “déjà vu”, is a graphics file format intended for scanned documents and books especially those which contain the combination of text, drawings, images and photographs. It was developed by AT&T Labs. It uses multiple techniques like image layer separation of text and background images, progressive loading, arithmetic coding and lossy compression for bitonal images. Since DJVU file can contain compressed yet high-quality colour images, photographs, text, and drawings and can be saved in less space therefore, it's used on web as eBooks, manuals, newspapers, ancient documents, etc.
