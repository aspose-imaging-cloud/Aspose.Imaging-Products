Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/filter/webp), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/filter/webp), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/filter/webp), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/filter/webp), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/filter/webp), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/filter/webp)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

WebP, introduced by Google, is a modern raster web image file format that is based on lossless and lossy compression. It provides same image quality while considerably reducing the image size. Since most of the web pages use images as effective representation of data, the use of WebP images in web pages results in faster loading of web pages. As per Google, WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs, while WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEG images. Images are compared based on the Structural Similarity (SSIM) index between WebP and other image file formats. WebP is a sister project of WebM multimedia container format.
