Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/flip-rotate/svgz), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/flip-rotate/svgz), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/flip-rotate/svgz), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/flip-rotate/svgz), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/flip-rotate/svgz), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/flip-rotate/svgz)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="SVGZ" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/svgz">}}
A file with .svgz extension is a compressed version of Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG) file. It is compressed with gzip compression and contains data in XML format. SVGZ files support transparency, gradients, animations, and filters. SVGZ files are smaller in size as compared to the default SVG files and this reduced file size helps transfer the graphics files online. Graphics designer create SVGZ files using tools like Adobe Illustrator, Corel PaintShop Pro, and others. However, SVGZ files can be generated by enabling GZip compression in the Apache Server while sending out the image data.
