Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/conversion/apng-to-psd), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/conversion/apng-to-psd), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/conversion/apng-to-psd), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/conversion/apng-to-psd), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/conversion/apng-to-psd), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/conversion/apng-to-psd)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

A file with .apng (Animated Portable Network Graphics) extension is a raster graphic format and is an unofficial extension to the Portable Network Graphic (PNG ). It comprises of multiple frames (each of PNG image) that represents an animation sequence. This gives similar visualization as a GIF file. APNG files support 24-bit images and 8-bit transparency. APNG is backward compatible with non-animated GIF files. APNG files use the same .png extension and can be opened by applications such as Mozilla Firefox, Chrome with APNG support, iMessage apps for iOS 10.
