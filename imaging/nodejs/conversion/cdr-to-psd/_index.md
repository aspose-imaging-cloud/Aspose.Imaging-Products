Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/conversion/cdr-to-psd), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/conversion/cdr-to-psd), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/conversion/cdr-to-psd), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/conversion/cdr-to-psd), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/conversion/cdr-to-psd), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/conversion/cdr-to-psd)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

A CDR file is a vector drawing image file that is natively created with CorelDRAW for storing digital image encoded and compressed. Such a drawing file contains text, lines, shapes, images, colours and effects for vector representation of image contents. CDR files can be opened with CorelDRAW as the primary application and can also be converted to other formats such as PDF, JPG, PNG, BMP and AI. It can be used for representation of various graphics data like brochures, tabloids, envelopes, and postcards. Besides CorelDRAW, other Corel products such as Corel Paintshop Pro and CorelDRAW Graphics suite can also open the CDR file formats.
