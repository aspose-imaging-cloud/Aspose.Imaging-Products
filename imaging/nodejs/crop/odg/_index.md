Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/crop/odg), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/crop/odg), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/crop/odg), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/crop/odg), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/crop/odg), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/crop/odg)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

The ODG file format is used by Apache OpenOffice's Draw application to store drawing elements as a vector image. It follows the XML based file format specifications outlined by Advancement of Structural Information Standards (OASIS). ODG represents drawings as vector images using points, lines and curves. Besides OpenOffice, LibreOffice and other applications also provide support for working with ODG file format. Other formats supported by OpenOffice, for example, include ODT, ODF, ODP and ODS.
