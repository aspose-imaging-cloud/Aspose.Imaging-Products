Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/crop/jpeg2000), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/crop/jpeg2000), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/crop/jpeg2000), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/crop/jpeg2000), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/crop/jpeg2000), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/crop/jpeg2000)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

JPEG 2000 (JP2) is an image coding system and state-of-the-art image compression standard. Designed, using wavelet technology JPEG 2000 can code lossless content in any quality at once. Moreover, without any substantial penalty in coding efficiency, JPEG 2000 have the capability to access and decode the same content efficaciously into a variety of other resolutions and qualities. The code streams in JPEG 2000 is significantly scalable having regions of interest that provide the facility for spatial random access. Possessing Up to 16384 diverse components with the dimensions in terapixels, and precision that can be high as 38 bits/sample.
