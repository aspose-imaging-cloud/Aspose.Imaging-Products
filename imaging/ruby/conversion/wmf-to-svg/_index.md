Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/conversion/wmf-to-svg), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/conversion/wmf-to-svg), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/conversion/wmf-to-svg), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/conversion/wmf-to-svg), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/conversion/wmf-to-svg), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/conversion/wmf-to-svg)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="WMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/wmf">}}
Files with WMF extension represent Microsoft Windows Metafile (WMF) for storing vector as well as bitmap-format images data. To be more accurate, WMF belongs to the vector file format category of Graphics file formats that is device independent. Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) uses the functions stored in a WMF file to display an image on the screen. A more enhanced version of WMF, known as Enhanced Meta Files (EMF), was published later that makes the format more feature rich. Practically, WMF are similar to SVG.
