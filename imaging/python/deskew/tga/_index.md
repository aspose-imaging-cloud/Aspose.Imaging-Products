Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/deskew/tga), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/deskew/tga), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/deskew/tga), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/deskew/tga), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/deskew/tga), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/deskew/tga)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

Truevision TGA, often referred to as TARGA, is a raster graphics file format created by Truevision Inc. (now part of Avid Technology). It was the native format of TARGA and VISTA boards, which were the first graphic cards for IBM-compatible PCs to support Highcolor/truecolor display.
