Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/resize/bmp), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/resize/bmp), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/resize/bmp), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/resize/bmp), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/resize/bmp), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/resize/bmp)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
