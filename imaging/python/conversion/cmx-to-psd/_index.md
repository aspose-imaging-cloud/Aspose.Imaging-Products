Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/conversion/cmx-to-psd), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/conversion/cmx-to-psd), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/conversion/cmx-to-psd), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/conversion/cmx-to-psd), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/conversion/cmx-to-psd), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/conversion/cmx-to-psd)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.
