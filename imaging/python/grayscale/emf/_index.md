Aspose.Imaging Cloud API is an image processing solution to process images (photos) within your cloud or web applications. 
It offers: cross-platform Image processing, including but not limited to conversions between various image formats (including uniform multi-page or multi-frame image processing), transformations (resize, crop, flip&rotate, grayscale, adjust), advanced image manipulation features (filtering, deskewing), AI features (i.e. object detection and reverse image search). 
It’s a Cloud API and does not depend on any software for image operations. One can easily add high-performance image conversion features with Cloud APIs within projects.
Flexible integrations options including SDKs for various languages ([Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/python/grayscale/emf), [Ruby](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/ruby/grayscale/emf), [.NET](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/net/grayscale/emf), [Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/java/grayscale/emf), [NodeJS](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/nodejs/grayscale/emf), [PHP](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/php/grayscale/emf)) and the use of the REST API allow to make the integration easy.

Enhanced metafile format (EMF) stores graphical images device-independently. Metafiles of EMF comprises of variable-length records in chronological order that can render the stored image after parsing on any output device. These variable-length records can be definitions of enclosed objects, commands for drawing, and graphics properties critical to render the image accurately. When a device opens an EMF metafile using its own graphics environment, the proportions, dimensions, colors and other graphic properties of original image remains same regardless of the opening device platform.
